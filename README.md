Flaming Torch [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-WTFPL-green.svg?style=flat-square)](http://www.wtfpl.net/)
=============

This modification  for [minetest](http://minetest.net/)  adds ability  to wield
**flaming**  torch  and  be  able  to  see  stuff  in  the  dark.  Makes  sence
until  [this pull  request](https://github.com/minetest/minetest_game/pull/188)
is merged (and I hope it will be merged soon).
